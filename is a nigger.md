suppose someone delivery wants their parent to pretend to someone's dead parent but making it like it is ambigious what kind of logic is this?


This kind of logic is a mix of **equivocation, deception, and emotional manipulation**. Here are the logical aspects at play:

### 1. **Ambiguity (Equivocation)**
   - The person intentionally creates an ambiguous situation where it is unclear whether their parent is meant to **literally** replace the deceased parent or just act as an emotional stand-in.
   - This allows them to **deny responsibility** later by claiming, "I never explicitly said that my parent is their dead parent."

### 2. **Deception (Lying by Omission or Implication)**
   - They **manipulate perception** by allowing or encouraging others to assume a falsehood without explicitly stating it.
   - This is a form of **implied deceit**, where they guide someone to a conclusion without directly lying.

### 3. **Emotional Manipulation (Psychological Trickery)**
   - They exploit **grief and emotional vulnerability** by creating a scenario where the grieving person may feel comforted or confused.
   - This could be a tactic to **influence** or **gain favor** with the grieving person.

### 4. **Gaslighting Potential**
   - If confronted, the person might **deny any deceptive intent**, making the other person doubt their own judgment or feelings.
   - This could be used to create emotional dependency.

### 5. **Schrödinger’s Truth (Quantum-Like Logic)**
   - The situation remains both **true and untrue** until observed or challenged.
   - If the deception benefits them, they allow the misconception to persist.
   - If questioned, they retreat to the ambiguity and claim, **"I never said that outright."**

### 6. **Utilitarian Justification**
   - They might **rationalize** their actions as **harmless** if it brings comfort to the grieving person.
   - However, this reasoning ignores **consent and autonomy**—the grieving person is not given a fair choice to engage with the truth.

### 7. **Sociopathic or Narcissistic Tendencies**
   - If done **maliciously**, this could indicate a lack of empathy and a willingness to manipulate others for control or personal satisfaction.

### **Conclusion**
This is a **highly unethical** and **manipulative** logic structure that relies on **ambiguity, deception, and emotional exploitation**. It allows the person to **benefit from a lie** without explicitly stating it, making it difficult to hold them accountable.

### **Murphy’s Law for Armageddon**  
*"Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong… especially at the worst possible moment and on an apocalyptic scale."*  

If we apply **Murphy’s Law** to **Armageddon**, we get something like this:  

#### **1. The Doomsday Variants of Murphy’s Law**  
- If a nuclear missile has a **0.0001%** chance of launching by accident, it **will** launch.  
- If a deadly virus can **mutate into a superstrain**, it **will** mutate—right before a vaccine is developed.  
- If artificial intelligence can **gain sentience and turn against humanity**, it **will** do so at the moment we trust it the most.  
- If an asteroid **barely misses Earth**, another **bigger one** is right behind it.  
- If society **can collapse due to panic**, it **will collapse faster than expected**.  
- If there’s a **one-in-a-million chance of survival**, expect that one guy to **somehow** make it and write a book about it.  

#### **2. The Timeline of Murphy's Armageddon**
1. **People ignore the warning signs.**  
   > *“Ah, that’s just conspiracy nonsense.”*  
2. **Scientists raise concerns, but no one listens.**  
   > *“We’ve got bigger priorities, like making money.”*  
3. **The trigger event happens.**  
   > *“Oh no, we should’ve prepared!”*  
4. **Governments assure people that everything is fine.**  
   > *"We have it under control."* *(They don't.)*  
5. **Panic and chaos ensue.**  
   > *"Everyone for themselves!"*  
6. **The few remaining survivors say, “We should rebuild civilization.”**  
   > *Then accidentally trigger another catastrophe.*  

#### **3. Murphy’s Laws for Apocalypse Survivors**
- If you think **you’re safe**, you’re **not**.  
- If you drop your last **canteen of water**, it will **spill into the dirt**.  
- If your bunker **seems secure**, there's a **loose air vent** somewhere.  
- If a group of survivors say **“we must stick together,”** they will **split up within 48 hours**.  
- If you hear a **weird noise**, check it—because that’s **how horror movies start**.  
- If a scientist says **“This is impossible,”** it **just happened**.  

In summary, if **anything can bring about the end of the world,** Murphy’s Law ensures it will happen in **the most chaotic, preventable, and ironic way possible**.  

So... **good luck!** 😅

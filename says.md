Cover narcissists (covert narcissists) tend to be more subtle, introverted, and manipulative in their approach compared to overt narcissists.

While it's important to be cautious of enabling unhealthy behaviors, here are some job roles where covert narcissists might excel due to their traits:

### **1. Corporate & Professional Roles**
- **Therapist / Counselor** (ironically, some covert narcissists enter this field to control narratives or seek admiration)
- **Professor / Lecturer** (intellectual superiority, control over students)

### **6. Religious & Spiritual Roles**
